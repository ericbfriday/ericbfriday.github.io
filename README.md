Eric's to do list

Change title's background texture to an original image.
Change body background color to in scheme color (using pictaculous to ID color)
Update font to in scheme color

If time permits:
reformat into bootstrap compatible format. Particular benefit is additional styling in employment section and mobile friendly nature of responsive/BS.
Update skills section to make interactive
